## **TEAM EVALUATION (30 Points)**

### **1. Completed Tasks & Objectives (10 Points)**

| **0-4 Points** | **5-8 Points** | **9-10 Points** |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Project demonstrates minimal completion of assigned tasks. Major features are missing or non-functional (e.g., no database connection, authentication not working, no API integration). Objectives are largely unmet, and deliverables fall significantly short of requirements. | Project shows substantial progress with most core tasks completed. Some features may need refinement or have minor issues (e.g., stats tracking works but has bugs, frontend connects but styling incomplete). Most key objectives are met, though some aspects may need improvement. | Project demonstrates exceptional completion of all assigned tasks. All features are fully functional and well-implemented (backend API working, frontend integrated, authentication functional, stats tracking accurate). Objectives are exceeded with additional enhancements or optimizations. |

**Day 1 Requirements:**
- ✓ Backend: Player stats tracking implemented
- ✓ Frontend: PlayerSetup component working
- ✓ Integration: Frontend successfully calls backend API
- ✓ Git: Code merged and working in main branch

**Day 2 Requirements:**
- ✓ Backend: Authentication system (register, login, JWT)
- ✓ Frontend: Auth components (Login, Register, ProtectedRoute)
- ✓ Integration: Full auth flow working end-to-end
- ✓ Persistence: Tokens stored, auto-login working

### **2. Team Dynamics & Collaboration (10 Points)**

| **0-4 Points** | **5-8 Points** | **9-10 Points** |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Minimal evidence of team collaboration. Communication appears inconsistent, and work distribution shows significant imbalance. One member did most work, others disengaged. Git history shows poor coordination. | Adequate team collaboration with basic communication patterns. Work distribution shows some balance, though coordination could be improved. Regular commits from all members but some gaps in communication or timing. | Excellent team collaboration with clear communication. Work is evenly distributed, and team members show strong coordination and support. Git commits show synchronized workflow, merge conflicts resolved together, clear evidence of helping each other. |

**Evidence of Collaboration:**
- Git commit history shows contributions from all members
- Merge conflicts resolved collaboratively
- Team documentation (status updates, notes) present
- Members helped each other when blocked
- Clear division of responsibilities

---

### **3. Creativity, Visuals & Style (10 Points)**

| **0-4 Points** | **5-8 Points** | **9-10 Points** |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|

No attention to user experience. | Adequate styling with basic custom CSS. Some visual polish applied. Interface is functional and reasonably attractive. Basic responsive design. Some thought given to user experience (colors, spacing, layout). | Exceptional creativity and visual design. Polished, professional-looking interface with custom styling. Excellent use of CSS (gradients, animations, transitions, hover states). Fully responsive. Strong attention to user experience and visual hierarchy. Goes beyond requirements with creative touches. |

**Styling Requirements:**
- Custom CSS (not just default styles)

|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| The individual demonstrates little to no understanding of the project's scope, tools, and patterns used by the team, struggling to describe their application or relevance. Cannot explain their role-specific technologies (e.g., backend dev can't explain Express routes, frontend dev can't explain React components). | The individual shows a basic understanding of the project's scope and can somewhat describe the tools and patterns the team employed, but with limited depth or clarity. Can explain their own code but struggles with broader project understanding. | The individual exhibits thorough understanding of the project's scope, clearly and confidently describing the tools and patterns used by the team. Can explain both their specific role AND how it integrates with teammates' work. Demonstrates deep insight into technical decisions. |

**Expected Knowledge by Role:**

**Backend Developer:**
- SQLite database setup and schema
- Express routing and middleware
- API endpoint design
- Authentication (JWT, bcrypt)
- Error handling

**Frontend Developer:**
- React components and state
- API integration with fetch
- React Router navigation
- Context API for global state
- Form validation and UX

#### **B. Project Contribution (2 Points)**

| **0 Points** | **1 Point** | **2 Points** |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| The individual fails to articulate their role within the team or how they contributed to the project, showing little evidence of meaningful participation. Git history shows minimal commits or no substantive work. | The individual can describe their role within the team and their contributions to the project, but the explanation lacks detail or the sense of significant involvement. Did baseline requirements but didn't go beyond. | The individual eloquently describes their specific role and meaningful contributions to the team process, clearly demonstrating active and significant participation in the project's success. Can walk through specific code they wrote and decisions they made. |

**Contribution Evidence:**
